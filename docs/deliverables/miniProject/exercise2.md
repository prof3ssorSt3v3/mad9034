# Exercise 2: Synthesized Research Results

## Introduction

Great work completing the user research phase! Now, it's time to distill all the valuable insights and observations into meaningful patterns.

## Instructions

::: tip Figma File

Continue to use the Figma file from Exercise 1.
Complete your work on the the page corresponding to Exercise 2.

:::

**Follow these steps to synthesize the research findings effectively:**

1. **Insight Gathering:** In the Figma file, Using the post-it notes from Exercise 1, write down each valuable insight or observation on a separate post-it note.

2. **Group Discussion:** Read aloud the collected insights to your group, fostering a collaborative understanding.

3. **Pattern Identification:** Identify common themes and group related insights to form meaningful patterns.

4. **Major Pattern Summarization:** Summarize your findings and distill them into three major patterns that you believe can be addressed through a digital product.

5. **Problem Statement Articulation:** Select one of the major patterns and frame it as a clear problem to be solved. Use the following format:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
We spoke to _____________________ [describe persona]

<span style="color:#333333; font-size: 14px;">(Share essential details about the targeted user persona based on your research.)</span>

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
We noticed that _____________________ [describe challenge or opportunity]

<span style="color:#333333; font-size: 14px;">(Clearly state the challenge or opportunity observed during the research.)</span>

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
We want to help with _____________________ [describe specifically what your product will solve]

<span style="color:#333333; font-size: 14px;">(Articulate the specific solution or purpose your digital product aims to achieve for the identified challenge or opportunity.)</span>

7.  **Submission:** Once your group has completed the problem statement, one member of the group should export your work and submit to Brightspace.

By following these instructions, your team will be well-equipped to present valuable insights and a well-defined problem statement, setting the stage for the next phase of your project. Happy synthesizing!
