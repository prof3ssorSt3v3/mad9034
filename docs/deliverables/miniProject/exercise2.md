# Exercise 2 — Synthesized Research Results

## Introduction

Great work completing the user research phase! Now, it's time to distill all the valuable insights and observations into meaningful patterns.

## Instructions

Your group can decide to complete this exercise either on sticky notes or with Figjam.

**Follow these steps to synthesize the research findings effectively:**

1. **Insight Gathering:** Write down each valuable insight or observation on separate post-it notes.

2. **Group Discussion:** Read aloud the collected insights to your group, fostering a collaborative understanding.

3. **Pattern Identification:** Identify common themes and group related insights to form meaningful patterns.

4. **Major Pattern Summarization:** Summarize your findings and distill them into three major patterns that you believe can be addressed through a digital product.

5. **Problem Statement Articulation:** Select one of the major patterns and frame it as a clear problem to be solved. Use the following format:

::: tip Problem Statement

We spoke to <span text="_____________________"></span> [describe persona]

<span style="color:#3eaf7c; font-size: 14px;">(Share essential details about the targeted user persona based on your research.)</span>

We noticed that <span text="_____________________"></span> [describe challenge or opportunity]

<span style="color:#3eaf7c; font-size: 14px;">(Clearly state the challenge or opportunity observed during the research.)</span>

We want to help with <span text="_____________________"></span> [describe specifically what your product will solve]

<span style="color:#3eaf7c; font-size: 14px;">(Articulate the specific solution or purpose your digital product aims to achieve for the identified challenge or opportunity.)</span>

7.  **Submission:** Once your group has completed the problem statement, one member of the group should export them your work and submit to Brightspace.
