# Exercise 2 — Synthesized Research Results

## Introduction

Great work completing the user research phase! Now, it's time to distill all the valuable insights and observations into meaningful patterns.

## Instructions

Your group can decide to complete this exercise either on sticky notes or with Figjam.

**Follow these steps to synthesize the research findings effectively:**

1. **Insight Gathering:** Write down each valuable insight or observation on separate post-it notes.

2. **Group Discussion:** Read aloud the collected insights to your group, fostering a collaborative understanding.

3. **Pattern Identification:** Identify common themes and group related insights to form meaningful patterns.

4. **Major Pattern Summarization:** Summarize your findings and distill them into three major patterns that you believe can be addressed through a digital product.

5. **Problem Statement Articulation:** Select one of the major patterns and frame it as a clear problem to be solved. Use the following format:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
We spoke to _____________________ [describe persona]

<span style="color:#3eaf7c; font-size: 14px;">(Share essential details about the targeted user persona based on your research.)</span>

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
We noticed that _____________________ [describe challenge or opportunity]

<span style="color:#3eaf7c; font-size: 14px;">(Clearly state the challenge or opportunity observed during the research.)</span>

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
We want to help with _____________________ [describe specifically what your product will solve]

<span style="color:#3eaf7c; font-size: 14px;">(Articulate the specific solution or purpose your digital product aims to achieve for the identified challenge or opportunity.)</span>

7.  **Submission:** Once your group has completed the problem statement, one member of the group should export them your work and submit to Brightspace.

By following these instructions, your team will be well-equipped to present valuable insights and a well-defined problem statement, setting the stage for the next phase of your project. Happy synthesizing!
