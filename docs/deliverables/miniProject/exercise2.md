# Exercise 2 — Synthesized Research Results

## Introduction

Great work completing the user research phase! Now, it's time to distill all the valuable insights and observations into meaningful patterns.

## Instructions

**Follow these steps to synthesize the research findings effectively:**

1. **Insight Gathering:** Write down each valuable insight or observation on separate post-it notes.

2. **Group Discussion:** Read aloud the collected insights to your group, fostering a collaborative understanding.

3. **Pattern Identification:** Identify common themes and group related insights to form meaningful patterns.

4. **Major Pattern Summarization:** Summarize your findings and distill them into three major patterns that you believe can be addressed through a digital product.

5. **Problem Statement Articulation:** Select one of the major patterns and frame it as a clear problem to be solved. Use the following format:

::: tip Problem Statement

<pre>We spoke to ________________ [describe persona]</pre>
