# Exercise 4 — Prototyping

## Introduction

Now that we have generated some ideas during the Brainstorming phase, it's time to start prototyping. While working on your prototype you will also start planning for usability testing.

## Instructions

1. **Storyboard (30-40 minutes)**
   - Get a piece of whiteboard, and draw a grid (6-10 squares)
   - Plot out the key steps in your scenario, that will help illustrate your solution, and get good user feedback on key areas
   - You don't need to sketch out every use case, just enough to get accurate feedback
   - Map out the flow that you'll use in the interview script
   - Figure out which steps/frames can be rough, and which need to be defined with more detail

**Start with the Problem Statement from W2D2:**

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
We spoke to _____________________ [describe persona]

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
We noticed that _____________________ [describe challenge or opportunity]

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
We want to help with _____________________ [describe specifically what your product will solve]

::: tip Solution

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
We believe that _____________________ (creating this experience)

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
For _____________________ (persona)

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
Will _____________________ (achieve this outcome)

:::

2. **Assign tasks (20 minutes)**

Assign a team member for each of the following tasks/roles:

- Script writer
- Mockup maker
- Prototype assembler (if not same person as mockup maker)
- Content creator
- Team members should step in and help do any work that's needed, but assign one person to OWN each task

Decide on a time to sync/work if the prototype is not completed in class today.

3. **Prototype (remainder of class + homework if needed)**
   - Create a complete interview script that your prototype will support
   - Create the necessary mockups to illustrate each step in the script
   - Assemble the mockups (Build a digital prototype in Figma)
   - Do a dry-run within your team to make sure the script and prototype match up
   - Adjust either if needed
