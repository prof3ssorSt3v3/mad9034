# Exercise 5 — Testing

## Introduction

This week's task involves the testing of your prototype, focusing on...

- Evaluate your prototypes with peers.
- Each group will assess their paper prototype with 3 classmates, assigning them key tasks to complete.
- Half of the groups will be responsible for testing their prototype, while the remaining groups will participate, and roles will be swapped afterward.

## Instructions

Within each group:

- One student will facilitate the test.
- Another student will manage the prototype.
- The rest of the group will take notes.

**Step 1: Preparing for the Tests**

1. Identify 2-3 tasks for your participants to accomplish.
2. Organize your prototype, ensuring the components are in the correct sequence to simulate tasks effectively.
3. Designate a facilitator, prototype handler, and note-taker.

**Step 2: Conducting the Test**

1. Introducing the Prototype:

   - Place the prototype or product in the participant's control.

2. Task Instructions:

   - Instruct participants to complete tasks one at a time.

3. Encouraging Verbalization:

   - Encourage participants to vocalize their thoughts and reasoning as they perform tasks.

4. Avoiding Intervention:

   - Refrain from intervening; allow participants sufficient time to work through challenges.

5. Maintaining Neutrality:

   - Maintain a neutral and unbiased demeanor throughout the testing process.

6. Questioning for Insights:

   - Pose questions to participants to gain deeper insight into their actions and decisions.

7. Evaluating Performance and Subjectivity:

   - Assess both the objective aspects of performance and the subjective elements, including:
     - Successful task completions and instances of failure.
     - Noting instances where participants seem confused.
     - Recognizing signs of frustration in participants.
     - Documenting any emotional responses observed.
     - Identifying specific steps within tasks where difficulties arise.

8. Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA):

   - Reference the Sample Non-Disclosure Agreement for Usability Testing:
     - Click the link while being logged into your Google Account.
     - Do not directly edit this NDA example.
     - Create a copy in your Google Drive to customize it according to your testing needs.
     - Ensure participants sign your NDA before beginning the testing process.
