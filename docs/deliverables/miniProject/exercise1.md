# Exercise 1: User Research

## Introduction

To begin the warm-up project, you'll collaborate in groups of 3-4 students to design an Apple Watch fitness application. The objective is to experience the User-Centered Design (UCD) process in a fast-tracked, 3-week design sprint.

In this initial phase, your focus is on conducting user research through user interviews. This step is vital as it serves as a prerequisite for exercises 2-6.

Remember, the UCD process emphasizes putting the users at the core of the design, ensuring that your application is user-friendly and aligned with their needs. By conducting user interviews effectively, you will be equipped to move forward with the rest of the warm-up project. Good luck with Exercise 1!

## Instructions

1. **Group Formation:** Gather 3-4 people to form your team. Use Brightspace > Groups to sign up as a group.

2. **Figma Project Creation:** Choose one team member to create a Figma project and name it Warm-upProject-Group#.

3. **Collaborator Invitations:** Invite all your team members and the professor to the Figma project with **edit permissions** so that everyone can collaborate seamlessly.

4. **Figma Files Import:** Download the provided Figma file, and import them into your newly created project. [Download Figma File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PTfAn4_ucUKQDlG7UtVZ-QFEVcxITuOv/view?usp=drive_link)

5. **Navigating to User Research:** Inside the Figma project, find "Exercise 1: User Research" and navigate to that section.

6. **Conducting Interviews:** Each student in your group is responsible for conducting 3 interviews, with 3 different individuals. Use the provided template to record your findings.

7. **Submission:** Once all interviews are completed, one member of the group should compile the interview results and export them. Submit the compiled interview results on Brightspace.

### Preparation Phase

Before conducting user interviews, follow these steps to ensure a successful research process:

1. **Set Clear Goals:** Clearly define the objectives and outcomes you aim to achieve through the interviews.

2. **Participant Selection:** Carefully select participants who represent your target user group, ensuring diverse perspectives.

3. **Protocol Definition:** Create a structured interview protocol, which includes specific topics and questions to address during the interviews.

4. **Assign Roles:** Designate roles for each team member, such as interviewer, note-taker, and observer, to maximize efficiency.

### Planning the Interview

Craft a thoughtful script to elicit valuable insights from participants. Your script should cover the following areas:

1. **Diet and Fitness Habits:** Understand participants' general diet and fitness routines.
2. **Fitness Tracker Usage:** Explore their current and past experiences with fitness tracker apps.
3. **Experiences with Apps and Services:** Gather feedback on their positive and negative experiences with other apps and services.
4. **Desired Features:** Identify the features they would like to see in an ideal fitness tracker.
5. **Additional Thoughts:** Encourage participants to share any other relevant thoughts related to the research goals.

**To ensure a smooth interview process:**

6. **Time Management:** Keep interviews concise, with a maximum duration of 15 minutes.
7. **Rehearse the Script:** Practice the interview script with your team before conducting interviews with users.

### Execution Phase

Follow these steps when conducting the interviews:

1. **Clarify the Goal:** Begin by explaining the purpose of the interview to participants, setting the context for the discussion.

2. **Time Expectation:** Inform participants that the interview will last approximately 15 minutes to manage their time commitments.

3. **Recording and Consent:** Seek permission to record the interview for accurate note-taking and ask participants to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to protect their privacy.

4. **Designated Note Taker:** Ensure you have a dedicated team member responsible for taking detailed notes during the interview.

By following these guidelines, each student should conduct three interviews, with a total of nine interviews per team. The user interview process will yield valuable insights to inform the design of an ideal fitness tracker, enhancing the success of your mini-project.
