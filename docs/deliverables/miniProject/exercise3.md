# Exercise 3 — Brainstorming

## Introduction

Welcome to the creative ideation phase! This week, we will channel our creativity to come up with innovative concepts that address the problem you identified in your problem statement.

## Instructions

Follow these steps to generate and refine your design concepts for an Apple Watch solution:

1. Problem Refresher: Start by revisiting the problem statement identified last week to focus your ideation efforts.

2. Crazy 8s Ideation Method: Utilize the Crazy 8s method for rapid idea generation:

- Spend 8 minutes to sketch 1-8 different concepts on a paper folded into 8 squares. (Individual work)
- Share your ideas with your team.
- Team members vote for their favorite ideas (3 votes each).
- Select the top 3 ideas to move forward. (Individual + team work)

## Steps

1. **Drawing Phase (8 mins):** Let your creativity flow as you sketch a diverse range of ideas in each square of the folded paper.

2. **Presentation & Voting (20 mins):** Take turns presenting your ideas to the team, with each person given 3 minutes. Team members cast their votes, and the top 3 ideas are selected for further development. (Individual + team work)

3. **Choosing & Development (25 mins):** Focus on three sketches that illustrate the progression through the problem. Show the starting point, mid-point, and end point. Use realistic content as much as possible to flesh out the concepts. (Individual work)

4. **Presentation and Decision (10 mins):** Each team member gets 1 minute to explain their chosen concept to the team. Collaboratively decide which idea will be prototyped. (Individual + team work)

By following these instructions, your team will go through a dynamic ideation process, generating innovative solutions for the Apple Watch application. Embrace the creative journey and collaborate effectively to select the most promising concept for prototyping. Good luck!
