# Exercise 3: Brainstorming

## Introduction

Welcome to the creative ideation phase! This week, you will channel your creativity to come up with innovative design concepts that address the problem you identified in your problem statement.

## Instructions

::: tip Figma File

Continue to use the Figma file from Exercise 1.
Complete your work on the page corresponding to Exercise 3.

:::

Follow these steps to generate and refine your design concepts for an Apple Watch solution:

1. Problem Refresher: Start by revisiting the problem statement identified last week to focus your ideation efforts.

2. Crazy 8s Ideation Method: Utilize the Crazy 8s method for rapid idea generation:

- Spend 8 minutes to sketch 1-8 different concepts on a paper folded into 8 squares. (Individual work)
- Share your ideas with your team.
- Team members vote for their favorite ideas (3 votes each).
- Select the top 3 ideas to move forward. (Individual + team work)

## Steps

1. **Drawing Phase (8 mins):** Let your creativity flow as you sketch a diverse range of ideas in each square of the folded paper.

2. **Presentation & Voting (20 mins):** Take turns presenting your ideas to the team, with each person given 3 minutes. Team members cast their votes, and the top 3 ideas are selected for further development. (Individual + team work)

3. **Choosing & Development (25 mins):** Focus on three sketches that illustrate the progression through the problem. Show the starting point, mid-point, and end point. Use realistic content as much as possible to flesh out the concepts. (Individual work)

4. **Presentation and Decision (10 mins):** Each team member gets 1 minute to explain their chosen concept to the team. Collaboratively decide which idea will be prototyped. (Individual + team work)

By following these instructions, your team will go through a dynamic ideation process, generating innovative solutions for the Apple Watch application. Embrace the creative journey and collaborate effectively to select the most promising concept for prototyping. Good luck!

5. **Submission:** Once you have completed your Crazy 8's on a piece of paper, take a photo and added it your Figma File.
