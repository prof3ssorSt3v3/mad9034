# Midterm - Digital Wireframes

## Introduction

In this phase of the project, you'll transition your initial hand-drawn prototype into a medium-fidelity greyscale wireframe using Figma. Leverage your newfound insights to refine the application's user interface, aiming for an enhanced user experience. This assignment offers an opportunity to bridge your theoretical knowledge with practical design principles.

## Task Overview

Your task involves the conversion of your initial prototype into a more polished and interactive digital wireframe. This step will significantly contribute to your app's usability and visual clarity.

## Submission Guidelines

- Submit the three essential screens as a cohesive PDF document. These screens typically include elements such as the home screen, browse screen, and detail screen.
- Ensure each wireframe is appropriately annotated to elucidate the user flow, particularly where it's crucial for understanding.

## Project Scope

While your app will ultimately encompass more screens, this midterm specifically focuses on refining and submitting three key screens. These screens should effectively capture the core functionality of your app.

## Wireframe Specifications

- Embrace a greyscale palette for the wireframes.
- Prioritize layout and content structuring over aesthetics at this juncture, so don't be concerned about colors and typography for now.
- Opt for the most common dimensions suitable for your chosen platform, ensuring consistency and coherence.

## Required Screens

Choose three essential screens that encapsulate the core interactions of your application. Examples include:

1. Home, Menu, and List screens
2. Home/Browse, Results, and Detail screens

## Guiding User Flow

To ensure a seamless and comprehensible user experience, address the following basic scenario tasks in your wireframes:

- Browsing through the app's content.
- Navigating to different sections or screens.
- Accomplishing specific actions within the app's context.
- Navigating to a designated screen based on user choices.
- Completing tasks that mirror real-world app functionality.
