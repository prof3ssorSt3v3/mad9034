# **Major Project: Assignment 7 - Midterm: Mid-Fidelity Wireframes (20% of your final grade)**

## **Introduction**

Transition your initial hand-drawn prototype into medium-fidelity digital wireframes using Figma. This phase focuses on integrating user insights from your testing session, and applying design principles to refine the app's user flow and interface for an optimal user experience.

## **Task Overview**

Convert your initial prototype into a refined, interactive, digital wireframe. This refined design will greatly enhance your app's visual clarity and usability.

## **Project Scope**

For this midterm, concentrate on refining and submitting **three pivotal screens that embody your app's central functionality**.

## **Wireframe Specifications**

- Utilize a greyscale color scheme.
- Focus on content layout and structure; disregard colors and typography at this stage.
- Maintain consistent dimensions tailored to your chosen platform.

## **Required Screens**

Select three primary screens representing the app's main interactions, such as:

1. Home
2. Menu screen
3. List screen

   OR

4. Home/Browse
5. Results
6. Detail screen

- Basic Scenario Tasks (user flow):
  - browse
  - navigate to
  - do something
  - navigate to a specific screen
  - do something

## **Guiding User Flow**

Ensure your wireframes cater to the following fundamental user interactions:

- Exploring the app's content.
- Shifting between various sections or screens.
- Executing specific in-app actions.
- Transitioning to specific screens based on user selections.
- Undertaking tasks that replicate authentic app use.

## **Submission Guidelines**

- Submit the main three screens
- The essential screens often comprise the home screen, browse screen, and detail screen.
- Clearly annotate each wireframe to highlight the user flow, especially in crucial junctures.
