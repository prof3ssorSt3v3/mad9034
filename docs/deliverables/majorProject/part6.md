# **Major Project: Test-Ready Low-Fidelity Prototype**

## **Introduction**

Prepare a test-ready, low-fidelity paper prototype, based on your pre-defined scenario and information architecture (IA). This exercise will help you validate your design concept's usability, ensuring users can seamlessly navigate through the intended workflow.

## **Instructions**

### 1. Prototype Development

- Finalize your low-fidelity prototype.
- Decide on a platform: iOS or Android.
- Utilize the [Paper screen template](http://sneakpeekit.com) for crafting your prototype.
- Reference your IA to draft the necessary app screens.

### 2. In-Class Testing and Feedback

- Engage with your classmates to test your app concept during class.
  - Conduct concept testing with a minimum of 3 classmates.
- Document all feedback gathered during the concept testing phase.

### 3. Refinement and Enhancements

- Implement design improvements based on the feedback acquired.

### 4. Documentation

- Integrate all screens into your Figma file.
- Annotate each screen clearly, providing a succinct description of your task flow.

## **Concept Testing**

Your users should be able to:

- **Browse** the app's content.
- **Navigate** to a specific screen to execute a task.
- **Switch** between tasks as needed.

**Required Screens:** (TBD: based on your User Scenarios)

**Task Flow:**

1. Browse the main content.
2. Navigate to a specific section.
3. Execute a primary action.
4. Browse a different section.
5. Perform a secondary action.

## **Submission**

1. **Prototype Capture**: Photograph or scan your paper prototype to capture your page layout.
2. **Figma Integration**: Add the captured prototype to your Figma file.
