# **Major Project - Test-Ready Low-Fidelity Prototype**

## **Introduction**

Prepare a test-ready low-fidelity prototype, either as a paper prototype or a digital wireframe, based on your predefined scenario and information architecture (IA). This exercise will help you validate your app concept's usability, ensuring users can seamlessly navigate through the intended workflow.

## **Instructions**

1. **Platform**: Decide on a platform - iOS or Android.
2. **Prototyping Tool**: Use the [Paper screen template](http://sneakpeekit.com) for crafting your prototype.
3. **Layout and Navigation**: Use your IA as a guide to sketch out the necessary app screens. Collaborate with a partner to test your prototype's layout and navigation. Ensure the user can effortlessly traverse the app's workflow.

## **Concept Testing**

Your users should be able to:

- **Browse** the app's content.
- **Navigate** to a specific screen to execute a task.
- **Switch** between tasks as needed.

**Required Screens:** (TBD: based on your User Scenarios)

**Task Flow:**

1. Browse the main content.
2. Navigate to a specific section.
3. Execute a primary action.
4. Browse a different section.
5. Perform a secondary action.

## **Summary**

1. **Prototype Completion**: Finalize your low-fidelity prototype before the Week 10-2 class.
2. **In-Class Testing**: Collaborate with your classmates to test your app concept during the Week 10-2 class.
3. **Refinement**: Implement design enhancements based on the feedback received.
4. **Figma Integration**: Incorporate all screens into your Figma file.
5. **Annotations**: Clearly label each screen and provide a concise description of your task flow.

## **Submission**

1. **Prototype Capture**: Photograph or scan your paper prototype to capture your page layout.
2. **Figma Integration**: Add the captured prototype to your Figma file.
