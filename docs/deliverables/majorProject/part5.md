# Major Project - Information Architecture

## Introduction

At this stage of the UX (user-centered) design process, you have gathered user research data, created 2 personas, and 1 usage scenario. Using this information you begin to create the information architecture for your app. You can review your competitor research to see what features other products have and how they are organized. Make sure your app keeps your persona in mind.

## Instructions

- Use your 2 personas and the usage scenario to create the information architecture (IA diagram) for your app.
- Review your competitor research to see what features other products have and how they are organized.
- Make sure you keep your persona in mind throughout the process.

| Task                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Organize all content | Write down the **names of all possible screens/content on sticky notes** <br> - **Group them**, create **subgroups** if necessary. <br> - **Name the groups**.                                                                             |
| Create the IA        | **Draw your IA using FigJam**. Represent the **hierarchy of information** and the different **sections and sub-sections** of the product. Put thought into how you **label** them keeping in mind **findability** and **discoverability**. |
| Choose the platform  | Decide **what platform you would like to design for**: iOS, Android or web application. <br> - **This is the platform that you will commit to for the rest of your assignments.**                                                          |
| Navigation structure | Decide what **navigation structure** is appropriate for the content you have, and how it is organized.                                                                                                                                     |
| Name your app        | Choose a **name** that doesnâ€™t already exist, that is catchy and that stands out from the other apps that offer a similar service                                                                                                          |

**Note:** A well-defined IA diagram will help you identify what screens to design/develop for your product.
