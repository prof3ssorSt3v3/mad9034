# Major Project - Product Research

## Introduction

We conduct product research to evaluate how a product might fit into the market, to learn what the desired characteristics might be. It helps companies to understand what the customers really want, and what is likely to succeed in the market using available technology. It can help to refine new product ideas.

For this assignment, you will get together with 3-4 students working on the same project as you are to conduct product research.

## Topics

You can select between the two predefined topics or define your own topic:

### 1. Network for Children with Disabilities

Families with **children with disabilities** often struggle to **find extra-curricular activities** that are appropriate for their child's special needs. Programs are few and far between, poorly advertised and therefore difficult to find, and often end up getting cancelled due to inadequate registration.

**You will work on designing an app where these activities can be posted and searched.**

There will be three main parts to the app:

- An interface for posting activities, adding necessary details for families to browse and understand them (ex. time, location, age range, abilities supported)
- An interface for browsing, searching, viewing and comparing activities
- An interface for creating a profile with a family's specific needs and requirements (ex. location, age range, interests, special needs, etc.)

**You will focus on the browsing/searching interface AND the profile-creating interface. You will simply account for the posting interface in your overall framework and architecture**

### 2. Network for in-home care for elderly people

**Elderly people** often struggle to **find in-home care and assistance** with everyday domestic tasks, self-care, travel to appointments, and other simple activities. It's difficult to know what sort of caregiver to hire for specific tasks, and difficult to know where to look for such a caregiver. Long term care arrangements are more common, making simple one-off needs for support especially difficult to arrange.

**You will work on designing an app where these types of domestic and self-care services can be posted and searched.**

There will be three main parts to the app:

- An interface for posting services, adding necessary details for elderly people and their families to browse and understand them (ex. Service offered, caregiver experience, locations served, etc.)
- An interface for browsing, searching, viewing and comparing services
- An interface for creating a profile with an elderly person would capture their specific needs and requirements (ex. location, age, living arrangement, mobility, special needs, etc.)

**You will focus on the browsing/searching interface AND the profile-creating interface. You will simply account for the posting interface in your overall framework and architecture**

### 3. Your choice!

A similar network (that you will define) where one group with a need is connected with another group that can deliver the service
**NOTE: Your idea must be approved by your teacher.**

You will define the specific audience your app targets, and the type of service it will connect this audience with.

**You will work on designing an app where these services can be posted and searched.**

There will be three main parts to the app:

- An interface for posting services, adding necessary details for them to be browsed and understood
- An interface for browsing, searching, viewing and comparing services
- An interface for creating a profile with a userâ€™s specific needs and requirements

**You will focus on the browsing/searching interface AND the profile-creating interface. You will simply account for the posting interface in your overall framework and architecture**

## Instructions

1. **Group Formation:** Gather 3-4 students working on the same project as you are to conduct product research.

2. **Figma Project Creation:** Choose one team member to create a Figma project and name it MajorProject-Group#.

3. **Collaborator Invitations:** Invite all your team members and the professor to the Figma project with edit permissions so that everyone can collaborate seamlessly.

4. **Figma Files Import:** Download the provided Figma file, and import them into your newly created project. [Download Figma File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZitqEnMXrTA9gFIgMG2JQgjfbwyWpKO2/view?usp=sharing)

5. **Division of Work:** Assign a group member to research each of these topics:
   1. **What competitors exist? (digital or other?)**
   - How are they structured?
   - What features do they have?
   - How do they look?
   - What is their business model?
     - Free with ads?
     - Subscription?
     - Commission?
     - Supported by donations/grants?
     - Other?
   2. **What similar products exist? (a. service provider + b. service seeker?)**
   - How are they structured?
   - What features do they have?
   - How do they look?
   - What is their business model?
     - Free with ads?
     - Subscription?
     - Commission?
     - Supported by donations/grants?
     - Other?
6. **Documenting your findings:**
   - Record your findings in the Figma file.
