# Major Project - Persona Research

## Introduction

We conduct persona (user) research to understand user behaviors, needs, and motivations through observation techniques, task analysis, and other feedback methodologies to: Produce measurable and actionable results.

For this assignment, you will get together with 3-4 students working on the same project to conduct persona (user) research.

## The Goal of Persona (user) Research

As you conduct your personal research you should aim to answer:

- **WHO** are you designing for?
- **WHAT** are their goals?
- **WHY** will they use your app?
- **WHERE, WHEN and HOW** do they perform tasks?
- What are the PROBLEMS with the current way they complete their tasks?

## Instructions

1. Identify your users for the primary and secondary persona
   - Discuss how you will access your users
2. Decide what questions to ask
3. Review and customize the persona research spreadsheet
   - Decide what you need to know about your users (demographic info.)
   - Make adjustments to the spreadsheet
   - Add/remove any columns you believe are necessary/unnecessary
4. Get access to users
5. Begin your interviews

---

#### 1. **Identify your users for the primary and secondary persona**

Access traditional market research data (if available):

- Established user base:
  - Get existing demographics data
- If no existing demographics data, survey current users
  - No user base (new company/product)
  - Research users of your competitors or similar companies, products or services

#### 2. **Decide What To Ask** ([A sample script](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/a-closer-look-at-personas-part-2/#overview))

- OVERVIEW
- DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE
- GOALS
- ATTITUDES AND MOTIVATIONS
- PROCESSES
- ENVIRONMENT
- PAIN POINTS
- TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY
- [MENTAL MODELS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model)
- PROJECTING INTO THE FUTURE
- WRAPPING UP

#### 3. Decide How To Ask – Individual Interviews

**Tips:**

- Ask primarily open-ended questions.
- Ask participants to show more than tell.
- Ask participants to describe current/past experiences, not imagine future states
- Ask for specific stories, especially about anything you can’t observe.
- Some good questions to ask
  - "Can you tell me about how you/your family currently does X?”
  - “Can you tell me about your most recent experience doing X?"
  - “Can you tell me some of the tools and resources you used?”
  - “Can you tell me why this is important?” (goals)
  - “Can you describe any frustrating experiences you have had with X?”
  - "I notice you [did something] - can you explain that to me?"
  - At the end: "Do you have any questions for me?"

#### 4. Get access to users

- Each member conduct at least 3 interviews for your PRIMARY persona
- NOTE: YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR GATHERING DATA ON YOUR SECONDARY PERSONA. IN-CLASS ACTIVITIES WILL WALK YOU THROUGH ALL THE STEPS REQUIRED, FOCUSED ON THE PRIMARY PERSONA. FOLLOW THE SAME STEPS FOR THE SECONDARY PERSONA.
  - Primary user persona - the browser/consumer (info seeker) of the service/program
  - Secondary user persona - the poster/deliverer (info provider) of the service/program

#### 5. Conduct your interviews to collect data – Things to remember:

- Try to keep it to 10-15 mins max
- Prepare a set of questions, AND follow-up probes
- Do a dry-run (with each other) to make sure that:
  - the questions make sense
  - are in a logical order
  - the interview won’t run too long/short

**Each team member runs the interview with 3 people.**

- Have a note-taker with you, so you can focus on facilitating the interview. ( Or, use zoom and record their voice. Ensure you get their consent first!)
- Get user permission in the Non Disclosure Agreement [(NDA example)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1jDQfyZg0oNOnJdgZYecHtr0E1483E683BaEdcUPfyzc/edit?usp=sharing)
