# Major Project: Assignment 8: Visual Design

## Introduction

Provide a visual design for your mobile app using UX visual design principles. Continue using Figma to apply visual treatment to the same screens as your wireframe. You will add visual design with the goal to increase usability, not to add "bells and whistles". Make sure your design document is organized for the prototype tool, Figma with proper frame names and labels.

## Instructions

### Screens Selection:

- Choose three pivotal screens for your design.
- It's recommended to utilize the same three screens from your midterm, unless there's a compelling rationale to select others, for which you must consult with your professor.

### Design Focus:

- Your grade will be influenced by how proficiently you employ the elements of visual design to exemplify and embody the principles of design and to enahnce the user experience of your mobile app.
