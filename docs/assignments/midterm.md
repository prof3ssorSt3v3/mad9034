# Midterm: 3 key wireframes

## Details

Convert your hand drawn prototype into a medium fidelity greyscale wireframe, using Figma. Take this opportunity to improve on the application user interface to support good user experience with your new knowledge. 

Submit the 3 screens (ex. Home screen, browse screen, detail screen) as a single pdf. Include annotation to explain user flow where is necessary. Your app will involve more screens, and you will continue to work on those. **The midterm requires that 3 key screens are submitted.**
