Work in groups of 3-4 to create a quick research plan/script to learn about people's fitness-tracker use/habits. Your questions should help you learn specifically about:

- General diet, exercise, and fitness habits
- Current and past use (or non-use) of fitness tracker(s)
- Positive health experiences or successes with fitness trackers
- Positive health experiences or successes with other products or services
- Negative health experiences or successes with fitness trackers
- Negative health experiences or successes with other products or services
- Perceived barriers to success with use of fitness trackers
- Desired features in an 'ideal' fitness tracker
- Any other thoughts or concerns on the topic

Each student in the group will run this quick research script on 3 people between classes 1 & 2.
