## Details

In-class exercise: [Week 2-1b In-class: Mini-project Intro, research script (slide 14 to 18)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kCPUsO4_f6Hz47THcBzFBiMlCJIzpvG7)

Work in groups of 3-4 to create a quick research plan/script to learn about people's fitness-tracker use/habits. 

**Things to consider:**
- What do you want to learn? (goals)
- Who can help you learn it? (participants)
- What will you ask them? (protocol)
- How will you execute the interview? (roles, set-up, etc)


**Your questions should help you learn specifically about:**
- General diet, exercise, and fitness habits
- Current and past use (or non-use) of fitness tracker(s)
- Positive health experiences or successes with fitness trackers
- Positive health experiences or successes with other products or services
- Negative health experiences or successes with fitness trackers
- Negative health experiences or successes with other products or services
- Perceived barriers to success with use of fitness trackers
- Desired features in an 'ideal' fitness tracker
- Any other thoughts or concerns on the topic

Each student in the group will run this quick research script on 3 people between classes 1 & 2. 


**Things to remember for each study session:**
- Try to keep it to 10-15 mins max
- Prepare a set of questions, AND follow-up probes
- Do a dry-run (with each other) to make sure that: 
    - the questions make sense
    - are in a logical order
    - the interview wonâ€™t run too long/short
