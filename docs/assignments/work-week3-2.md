# Week 3 Class 2 work: (Paper) Prototype

## Details

In-class exercise: [Week 3-2b In-class: Prototyping](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NIPEEpSmhYMkEWt5WsQyFekJgUcB-2-y)

Select 1 concept from class 1 (or, a combination of multiple concepts) and create a prototype to test next week.


**Step 1 : Storyboard (30-40 minutes)**

- Get a piece of whiteboard, and draw a grid (6-10 squares)
- Plot out the key steps in your scenario, that will help illustrate your solution, and get good user feedback on key areas  
    - You don't need to sketch out every use case, just enough to get accurate feedback
- Map out the flow that you'll use in the interview script
- Figure out which steps/frames can be rough, and which need to be defined with more detail or fidelity


**Step 2 : Assign tasks (20 minutes)**

- Assign a team member for each of the following tasks/roles:
    - Script writer
    - Mockup maker
    - Prototype assembler (if not same person as mockup maker)
    - Content creator
- Team members should step in and help do any work that's needed, but assign one person to OWN each task
- Decide on a time to sync/work if the prototype is not completed in class today


**Step 3 : Prototype (remainder of class + homework if needed)**

- Create a complete interview script that your prototype will support
- Create the necessary mockups to illustrate each step in the script
- Assemble the mockups
- Do a dry-run within your team to make sure the script and prototype match up
    - Adjust either if needed
