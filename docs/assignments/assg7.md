# Information architecture

## Details


### Backstory: Information Architecture (IA diagram)

At this stage of the UX (user-centered) design process, you have gathered user research data, created 2 personas, and 1 usage scenario. Using this information you begin to create the information architecture for your app. You can review your competitor research to see what features other products have and how they are organized. Make sure your app keeps your persona in mind.

**Assignment:**

- Create a name for your app.
- Determine the platform. (iOS, Android, mobile web, etc.)
- Organize, structure, and label content to create an information architecture diagram listing primary and secondary navigations for your app. Your IA diagram will show the core navigation system of the product. 
- Submit your information architecture diagram in digital format (no hand drawings).
- Filename: _FirstNameLastName-IAdiagram.pdf_


**Note:** A well-defined IA diagram will help you identify what screens to design/develop for your product.
