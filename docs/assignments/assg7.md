# Information architecture

## Details

### 1. Backstory – Scenario

Based on the user research, you have created 2 personas of your target users. You now want to create a hypothetical usage scenario to understand how your primary persona may interact with your app. "What are some of the things my user will try to accomplish with my app?"

**Assignment:**

- Create 1 text-based scenario for your app. 
- Your Usage Scenario must include – Basic user info, scenario/goal, summary (tie in user goals), tasks, and context of use. [(See example in slides for MAD9034 7-1b In-class: Usage Scenarios)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NIPEEpSmhYMkEWt5WsQyFekJgUcB-2-y?usp=sharing)
- Submit your scenario as a Word or PDF file. [(Scenario template)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m5uQQLEmWjMc_W-XJiXAuKD8mux0BydoBEUtzF4iC50/edit?usp=sharing)
- Filename: _FirstNameLastName-Scenario.pdf_ (or docx) 

**Note:** Your usage scenario will be part of your usability testing script for week 13. 



### 2. Backstory: Information Architecture (IA diagram)

At this stage of the UX (user-centered) design process, you have gathered user research data, created 2 personas, and 1 usage scenario. Using this information you begin to create the information architecture for your app. You can review your competitor research to see what features other products have and how they are organized. Make sure your app keeps your persona in mind.

**Assignment:**

- Create a name for your app.
- Determine the platform. (iOS, Android, mobile web, etc.)
- Organize, structure, and label content to create an information architecture diagram listing primary and secondary navigations for your app. Your IA diagram will show the core navigation system of the product. 
- Submit your information architecture diagram in digital format (no hand drawings).
- Filename: _FirstNameLastName-IAdiagram.pdf_


**Note:** A well-defined IA diagram will help you identify what screens to design/develop for your product.
