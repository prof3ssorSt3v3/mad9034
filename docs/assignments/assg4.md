## Details

- Based on the project chosen, you are to conduct 3 user interviews each [(Major Project Brief)](./project-brief.md)

### The Goal of Persona (user) Research
Understand user behaviors, needs, and motivations through observation techniques, task analysis, and other feedback methodologies to: 
Produce measurable and actionable results.
- WHO are you designing for?
- WHAT are their goals?
- WHY will they use your app?
- WHERE, WHEN and HOW do they perform tasks?
- What are the PROBLEMS with the current way they complete their tasks?


### To begin, form a group with 3~4 people working on the same project as you.

1. Identify your users for the primary and secondary persona
    - Discuss how you will access your users
2. Decide what questions to ask (Week 5-1b slide 20)
3. Review and customize the [persona research spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oQMsQwGLWMzClIwAz_1pMDOw2DaCgBIaGXyAhFnW7XY/edit?usp=sharing)
    - Decide what you need to know about your users (demographic info.)
    - Make adjustments to the spreadsheet
    - Add/remove any columns you believe are necessary/unnecessary
4. Get access to users
5. Begin your interviews


#### 1. **Identify your users for the primary and secondary persona**
Access traditional market research data (if available):
- Established user base:
    - Get existing demographics data
- If no existing demographics data, survey current users
    - No user base (new company/product)
    - Research users of your competitors or similar companies, products or services


#### 2. **Decide What To Ask**
- OVERVIEW 
- DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE 
- GOALS
- ATTITUDES AND MOTIVATIONS
- PROCESSES 
- ENVIRONMENT 
- PAIN POINTS 
- TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY 
- [MENTAL MODELS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model)
- PROJECTING INTO THE FUTURE
- WRAPPING UP 


#### 3. Decide How To Ask: Individual Interviews for this assignment

**Create a quick research plan/script to learn about people's fitness-tracker use/habits.** 

Your questions should help you learn specifically about:

General diet, exercise, and fitness habits

- Current and past use (or non-use) of fitness tracker(s)
- Positive health experiences or successes with fitness trackers
- Positive health experiences or successes with other products or services
- Negative health experiences or successes with fitness trackers
- Negative health experiences or successes with other products or services
- Perceived barriers to success with use of fitness trackers
- Desired features in an 'ideal' fitness tracker
- Any other thoughts or concerns on the topic


**Tips:**
- Ask primarily open-ended questions.
- Ask participants to show more than tell.
- Ask participants to describe current/past experiences, not imagine future states
- Ask for specific stories, especially about anything you can’t observe.
- Some good questions to ask
    - "Can you tell me about how you/your family currently does X?”
    - “Can you tell me about your most recent experience doing  X?"
    - “Can you tell me some of the tools and resources you used?”
    - “Can you tell me why this is important?” (goals)
    - “Can you describe any frustrating experiences you have had with X?”
    - "I notice you [did something] - can you explain that to me?"
    - At the end: "Do you have any questions for me?"


#### 4. Get access to users
#### 5. Conduct your interviews to collect data

**Things to remember:**
- Try to keep it to 10-15 mins max
- Prepare a set of questions, AND follow-up probes
- Do a dry-run (with each other) to make sure that:
    - the questions make sense
    - are in a logical order
    - the interview won’t run too long/short

**Each team member runs the interview with 3 people.**

Have a note-taker with you, so you can focus on facilitating the interview. ( Or, use zoom and record their voice. Ensure you get their consent first!  )
