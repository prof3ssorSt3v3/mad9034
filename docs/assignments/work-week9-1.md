# Week 9 Class 1 work: User flows to validate IA

## Details

In-class exercise: [Week 9-1b In-class: User flows validating IA](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NIPEEpSmhYMkEWt5WsQyFekJgUcB-2-y)

We talk a lot about validating and iterating in the design process. Today, you’ll validate your **Information Architecture** and iterate if needed.

We’ll use user flows to validate how effective your proposed IA is.

1. Identify 3-4 user flows (20 mins)
    - Identify the common paths a user is likely to take through your application, based on what you learned in your interviews, and on your personas

2. Validate user flows against your IA (remainder of class)
    - Put these flows through your proposed IA to identify inefficiencies or opportunities

::: warning Note
After iterating your IA, resubmit the revision.
