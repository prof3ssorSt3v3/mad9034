This step is challenging. To analyze your **Persona Research data**, you must look at a range of variables across a range of participants, and find the patterns that are meaningful to your project. 

- Identify attributes of participantsâ€™ behaviour and attitude that were captured in your research
- Rank each participant on each attribute
- Look for common traits among participants who share similar attributes. 
- Each group of similar participants with similar attributes and common traits can be formed into a persona.
    - Identify as many groups of participants who share more common attributes than disparate attributes.
    - Each of these groups should be represented by one persona.
- At some point, you will determine the main groups (primary and secondary personas) you will be designing for.

::: warning Note
The outcome of this exercise will lead you to create the primary and secondary personas for your final project.
