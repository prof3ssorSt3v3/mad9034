# Week 4 Class 1 work: User Testing

## Details

In-class exercise: [Week 4-1b In-class: User testing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kCPUsO4_f6Hz47THcBzFBiMlCJIzpvG7)

- Test your prototypes on classmates.
- Each group will test their paper prototype on 3 classmates, asking them to complete key tasks.
- Half the groups will test their prototype while the other half act as participants, then we switch.

In each group:

- One student facilitates the test
- One student manages the prototype
- Rest of group takes notes


**Step 1: Prepare for your tests**
- Choose 2-3 tasks that you’ll ask your participants to complete
- Prepare your prototype (make sure you have the parts in the correct order to simulate tasks)
- Appoint a facilitator, prototype-handler, and note-taker


**Step 2: Test** 

Remember:
- Put the prototype/product in your participant’s hands/control
- Ask your participant to complete one task at a time
- Ask your participant to think out loud as they complete tasks
- Do not jump in to help - give your participant time to figure it out
- Remain neutral
- Ask questions to better understand their actions
- Measure performance and subjective metrics like:
    - Successes / failures 
    - Confusion 
    - Frustration 
    - Emotional reactions
    - Specific steps in the tasks where these occur
