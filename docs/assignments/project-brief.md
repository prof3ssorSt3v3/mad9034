## Details

- For your major project, you will work individually.
- You will choose among the three product/app ideas described below


### Option 1: A network to find activities for children with disabilities

Families with children with disabilities often struggle to find extra-curricular activities that are appropriate for their child's special needs. Programs are few and far between, poorly advertised and therefore difficult to find, and often end up getting cancelled due to inadequate registration.

You will work on designing an app where these activities can be posted and searched.

There would be three main parts to the app:

- An interface for posting activities, adding necessary details for families to browse and understand them
- An interface for browsing, searching, viewing and comparing activities
- An interface for creating a profile with a family's specific needs and requirements 

    **You will focus on the browsing/searching interface AND the profile-creating interface. However you will simply account for the posting interface in your overall framework and architecture**


### Option 2: A network to find in-home care for elderly people

Elderly people often struggle to find in-home care and assistance with everyday domestic tasks, self-care, travel to appointments, and other simple activities. It's difficult to know what sort of caregiver to hire for specific tasks, and difficult to know where to look for such a caregiver. Long term care arrangements are more common, making simple one-off needs for support especially difficult to arrange.

You will work on designing an app where these types of domestic and self-care services can be posted and searched.

There would be three main parts to the app:

- An interface for posting services, adding necessary details for elderly people or their - families to browse and understand them
- An interface for browsing, searching, viewing and comparing services
- An interface for creating a profile where an elderly person would capture their specific needs and requirements
 
    **You will focus on the browsing/searching interface AND the profile-creating interface. However you will simply account for the posting interface in your overall framework and architecture**


### Option 3: A similar network (that you will define) where one group with a need is connected with another group that can deliver the service

NOTE: Your idea must be approved by your instructor.

You will define the specific audience your app targets, and the type of service it will connect this audience with.

There would be three main parts to the app:

- An interface for posting services, adding necessary details for users to browse and understand them
- An interface for browsing, searching, viewing and comparing services
- An interface for creating a profile where users would capture their specific needs and requirements

    **You will focus on the browsing/searching interface AND the profile-creating interface. However you will simply account for the posting interface in your overall framework and architecture**

**Note:** If you decide to create **your own product/app idea**, please write a project brief to describe what it is in the same writing format as Option 1 and 2. You will <span style="color: #cc0000;"> submit your project description to your teacher(s) before Week 05 Class 1.</span>
