### Test Steps

**Introduction (1-2 mins)**
- Introduce yourself, the project, and the purpose of the test
- Tell participants that you’re testing the prototype, ask to ‘think out loud’
**The testing (5-7 mins)**
- Introduce the task(s), one at a time, including the scenario and the task to be completed
- Observe closely, without interruption, without offering help (take notes!)
- Let them find a way out and wait until they question you
- After tasks are completed, allow for additional feedback or questions
**Take notes (1-2 mins)**
- Jot down major observations, specific quotes, successes & failures

**Debrief**

- How did it go?
- What did you observe?
- What changes do you believe are needed?
- Quickly jot down the changes, while they're still fresh in your mind


::: warning Note
Based on your concept testing, you will make design improvements by creating digital wireframes for the midterm submission.
