# MAD9034 - User Experience Design 

::: tip Welcome to UXD

Going beyond the basics of graphics and user interface fundamentals, students learn how to combine these elements to create intuitive, efficient and enjoyable products. Students are introduced to a user-centered approach to designing mobile applications. Students begin with user research and build toward creating interaction design specifications in the form of wireframe documents. Topics such as information architecture, navigation and orientation, and interaction design principles are discussed and applied.
