## Usability Testing

Usability testing is the practice of testing how easy a design is to use on a group of representative users. It involves observing users as they attempt to complete tasks and can be conducted repeatedly, from early development until a product’s release.

### What Happens in a Usability Test?

In a typical usability test, a test moderator gives test participants a series of tasks that they must perform with the prototype or product. The tasks represent actions that an end user would typically carry out with the finished product. During the test, the moderator observes each participant’s steps, routes, and reactions, often also recording the test session on video.

Usability testing can take various forms, but at its core, it involves observing users as they interact with a product. A common methodology is the think-aloud protocol, where participants verbalize their thoughts, feelings, and frustrations while using a product. This method provides valuable insights into the user's thought process and helps identify areas where users may encounter difficulties. Another advanced technique is eye-tracking, which tracks where and how long a user looks at different areas of a screen. This can be particularly revealing in understanding user attention and engagement. These methods combined offer a comprehensive view of how users interact with and respond to a product, highlighting areas for improvement and ensuring the final product meets user needs and expectations.

### Why Conduct Usability Testing?

The benefits of usability testing are manifold. It not only helps in identifying usability issues before a product is fully developed but also enhances user satisfaction by ensuring that the product meets their needs and expectations. By involving users in the design process, usability testing can significantly reduce the time and cost associated with reworking features after a product's release.

**Summary:**

- Cheaper to fix problems found prior to coding.
- Learn if participants are able to complete the specified tasks successfully.
- Learn how long it takes to complete the specified tasks.
- Discover qualitative information (how happy are they with your service).
- Identify required changes to enhance usability.

### 3-Step Rule for Usability Testing

**Step 1 (early stage):**

- Use any general user to help encounter basic usability issues (navigation, etc).

**Step 2 (mid project):**

- Use users with a broad spectrum of ability (beginner, advanced).

**Step 3 (later stage):**

- Use target users to refine any specific issues (persona).

- **Expanded Content**: This rule provides a structured approach to usability testing throughout the development process. In the early stages, testing with general users can uncover basic usability issues like navigation problems. As the project progresses, involving users with a broader range of abilities, from beginners to advanced users, helps in identifying more nuanced usability challenges.

### Participants

Recruit 5 users for a usability session. Typically, 5 users will surface 80% of the problems. Beyond 5 users, you will start to see the same patterns. The best practice is to test with 5 users, incorporate their feedback and your observations in the prototype and then test with another 5 users.

The choice of participants is crucial in usability testing. While the rule of five participants is a good starting point, it's important to ensure diversity among the test users. This includes a mix of genders, ages, technical proficiencies, and other demographic factors relevant to the product.

### Types of Usability Testing

#### Hallway Testing

**Who?** Anyone (Minus people working on project)
**What?** Asking randomly selected people to test a feature of a product
**Why?** Help you discover "brick walls", issues that don't allow users to continue

#### Lab Testing

**Who?** Target User
**What?** Real-time communication between user and evaluator conducting tests in a controlled environment
**Why?** Formal setting with proper equipment to record, observe etc

#### Remote Testing

**Who?** Target User
**What?** Testing remote users via conferencing software or asynchronous methods: click streams, user logs etc
**Why?** Cheaper, you can test with anyone around the world, can simulate real life context

#### Guerilla Testing

Similar to hallway testing, but even rougher & quicker. Usually < 15 mins. You approach a person, ask them if they would like to answer a few questions about your product, give them a couple of tasks to do, observe their interaction, ask about their experience, and you’re done.

Each type of usability testing serves a specific purpose. Hallway testing, for instance, is quick and informal, ideal for early-stage feedback. Lab testing, on the other hand, is more controlled and provides in-depth insights.

## Testing Documentation

### Test Plan

A test plan is a document which captures:

- Who will be your participants? (profiles)
- What are you going to test? (scenarios)
- Where will the test be held? (remote/lab/etc)
- When will the test be held? (date and time)
- Why are you testing those scenarios? (test metrics)
- How are you going to conduct the test? (method)

#### Why Create a Test Plan?

Three main reasons:

1. To help yourself get organized.
2. To communicate the plan to stakeholders, team, and management for feedback or approval.
3. To guide you (or your colleagues) while executing the usability test.

#### Your Test Plan Should Include the Following Sections

- Project name
- Purpose
- Location
- Schedule
- Sessions
- Participants
- Scenarios
- Quantitative metrics
- Roles

### Test Script

A test script is a document which contains the words that a facilitator will say to the participant during the test. Sometimes also referred to as a protocol or moderator guide.

/>

#### Why Write a Test Script?

Creating a script helps you to:

- Focus your mind on what exactly you’re testing, so that your usability test doesn’t drift and remains focused.
- Ensure test consistency across multiple test participants.
- Talk about different user scenarios.
- Clearly articulate the different goals you’re testing.
- Put your users’ minds at ease.

#### Your Test Script Should Include the Following Sections

- Welcome
- User profile questions (if required)
- Introducing the test and product
- For each task...
  - Introduce the scenario
  - Introduce the task, and specific instructions to be given
  - Assistance to offer (if needed, and when)
  - Follow-up questions
- Overall follow-up questions
- Satisfaction rating
- Conclusion

### NDA

An NDA (non-disclosure agreement) is a contract between the usability test participant and the business, which prohibits them from sharing information about your site or app when participating in your test.

#### Why Use an NDA?

An NDA allows you to share pre-release concepts and products with external stakeholders, while protecting them from being circulated, and potentially ‘leaked’ externally. It protects your ideas from getting stolen!

#### Outline

As an NDA is a legal document, you should not try to write one yourself without the necessary legal expertise. There are many templates available. Ensure that you enter:

- Your project/company name
- What will be tested
- What you will be observing and documenting
- Any special conditions/what participants ARE permitted to share
