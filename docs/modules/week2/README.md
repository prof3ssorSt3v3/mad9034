## User Research

### Definition and Goals

User research focuses on understanding user behaviors, needs and motivations through interviews, surveys, usability evaluations and other forms of feedback methodologies. It is used to understand how people interact with products and evaluate whether design solutions meet their needs.”

[What and Why: User Research](https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-research.html)

**Building empathy for users**

- Who are the users?
- What are their goals, needs and expectations interacting with your product?
- What is the context of use?

### Attitudinal vs Behavioural

**Attitudinal:** What people say (surveys, focus groups, interviews, card sorting) Marketing studies rely on attitudinal research.

**Behavioural:** What people do (observation sessions, first-click testing, eye tracking, moderated usability testing, A/B testing) Usability studies focus on behavioural research.

### Qualitative vs Quantitative

**Qualitative:** gather data observing users directly

**Quantitative:** analysis of data gathered from answers to questions

## Analysis

### Definition and Goals

User research analysis is about making sense of the data that you collected during your study.

**Goals**

- Avoid being influenced by your own bias or interests
- Ensure opportunities aren’t overlooked
- Be able to share with other people (product stakeholders) how you reached your conclusions
- Know what you don’t know

### Thematic Analysis

A systematic method of breaking down and organizing rich data from qualitative research by tagging individual observations and quotations with appropriate codes, to facilitate the discovery of significant themes.

[How to Analyze Qualitative Data from UX Research: Thematic Analysis](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/thematic-analysis/)<br>
[Workshop Activities](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/workshop-activities/)

### Thematic analysis method

**STEP 1:** Familiarize yourself with your data.<br>
**STEP 2:** Search for patterns across all the interviews<br>
**STEP 3:** Identify preliminary themes<br>
**STEP 4:** Review themes<br>
**STEP 5:** Name and define themes<br>

## Design Sprint

A design sprint is a structured and time-bound process used by teams to quickly conceptualize, prototype, and test new ideas or solutions. It's typically done in a span of about one to five days, and it aims to address challenges and develop innovative solutions through a collaborative and iterative approach. Here's a summary of the key steps involved in a design sprint:

1. **Understand:** Identify the problem.
2. **Diverge:** Generate a bunch of ideas.
3. **Converge:** Pick the best idea.
4. **Prototype:** Make a simple model of your idea.
5. **Test:** Get feedback from real users.
6. **Iterate:** Improve your idea based on feedback.
7. **Decide:** Choose whether to pursue the idea further.

The process is quick, collaborative, and helps teams avoid wasting time on ideas that might not work.
