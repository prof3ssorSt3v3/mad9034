# Week 2: Research and analysis overview

::: warning Required Preparation

Please ensure that you prepare for each week's lessons by thoroughly reviewing the weeks module prior to the start of class. This preparation is essential to ensure you are fully informed and ready to actively engage in the upcoming topics and discussions. Your active participation and success in the course depend on meeting this requirement diligently.

:::

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, students will:

- Have a deeper understanding of the role of research and analysis in the UXD process
- Have learned and practiced some research and analysis skills, using appropriate tools

## User Research

### Definition and Goals

User research focuses on understanding user behaviors, needs and motivations through interviews, surveys, usability evaluations and other forms of feedback methodologies. It is used to understand how people interact with products and evaluate whether design solutions meet their needs.”

**Building empathy for users**

- Who are the users?
- What are their goals, needs and expectations interacting with your product?
- What is the context of use?

### Attitudinal vs Behavioural

**Attitudinal:** What people say (surveys, focus groups, interviews, card sorting) Marketing studies rely on attitudinal research.

**Behavioural:** What people do (observation sessions, first-click testing, eye tracking, moderated usability testing, A/B testing) Usability studies focus on behavioural research.

### Qualitative vs Quantitative

**Qualitative:** gather data observing users directly

**Quantitative:** analysis of data gathered from answers to questions

### A selection of methods used in UX Design

|                                      |                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Card Sorting**<br>                 | Allows users to group labels written on cards in categories that make sense to them. This helps ensure that the application structure matches the way users think.       |
| **Contextual Interviews**<br>        | Enable you to observe users in their natural environment, giving you a better understanding of the way users work.                                                       |
| **First Click Testing**<br>          | A testing method focused on navigation, which can be performed on a functioning website, a prototype, or a wireframe.                                                    |
| **Focus Groups**<br>                 | Moderated discussion with a group of users, allow you to learn about user attitudes, ideas, and desires.                                                                 |
| **Heuristic Evaluation**<br>         | Usability experts evaluating your website (app) against a list of established guidelines.                                                                                |
| **Individual Interviews**<br>        | One-on-one discussions with users show you how a particular user works. They enable you to get detailed information about a user's attitudes, desires, and experiences.  |
| **Parallel Design**<br>              | Involves several designers pursuing the same effort simultaneously, but independently, with the intention to combine the best aspects of each for the ultimate solution. |
| **Persona**<br>                      | Create a representative user based on available data and user interviews. Some personal details may be fiction, but the information used to create the user type is not. |
| **Prototyping**<br>                  | Explore ideas before implementing them by creating a mock-up. A prototype can range from a paper mock-up to interactive html pages.                                      |
| **Survey**<br>                       | A series of questions asked to multiple users of your website, help you learn about the people who visit your site.                                                      |
| **System Usability Scale (SUS)**<br> | SUS is a technology independent ten item scale for subjective evaluation of the usability.                                                                               |
| **Task Analysis**<br>                | Involves learning about user goals, including what users want to do on your App, and helps you understand the tasks that users will perform on it.                       |
| **Usability Testing**<br>            | Usability testing refers to evaluating a product or service by testing it with representative users.                                                                     |
| **Use Case**<br>                     | Use cases, scenarios and storyboards focus on describing how users use your product and their goals.                                                                     |

## Analysis

### Definition and Goals

User research analysis is about making sense of the data that you collected during your study.

**Goals**

- Avoid being influenced by your own bias or interests
- Ensure opportunities aren’t overlooked
- Be able to share with other people (product stakeholders) how you reached your conclusions
- Know what you don’t know

### Thematic Analysis

A systematic method of breaking down and organizing rich data from qualitative research by tagging individual observations and quotations with appropriate codes, to facilitate the discovery of significant themes.

### Thematic analysis method

**STEP 1:** Familiarize yourself with your data.
**STEP 2:** Search for patterns across all the interviews
**STEP 3:** Identify preliminary themes
**STEP 4:** Review themes
**STEP 5:** Name and define themes
