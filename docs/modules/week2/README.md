## Class 1: User Research

### Definition and Goals

User research focuses on understanding user behaviors, needs, and motivations through various methodologies. It is used to evaluate whether design solutions meet user needs.
[What and Why: User Research](https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-research.html)

### Building Empathy for Users

Understanding your users is the foundation of effective user research. It involves answering critical questions:

- **Who are the users?** Define user personas to represent different user groups.
- **What are their goals, needs, and expectations when interacting with your product?** Conduct user interviews and surveys to gather insights.
- **What is the context of use?** Explore the environments in which users engage with your product.

### Attitudinal vs. Behavioral Research

User research can be categorized into attitudinal and behavioral research:

- **Attitudinal Research:** Focuses on what users say, gathered through surveys, focus groups, interviews, or card sorting. This type of research is often used in marketing studies.
- **Behavioral Research:** Concentrates on what users do, observed through methods like usability testing, first-click testing, eye tracking, and A/B testing. Usability studies rely on behavioral research.

### Qualitative vs. Quantitative Research

User research methods can be broadly classified into qualitative and quantitative approaches:

- **Qualitative Research:** Involves gathering data by observing users directly, often through interviews, contextual inquiries, and observations.
- **Quantitative Research:** Analyzes data gathered from answers to structured questions, often through surveys and usability testing with larger sample sizes.

## Class 2: Analysis

### Definition and Goals

User research analysis is about making sense of the collected data and reaching meaningful conclusions.

**Goals**

- Avoid being influenced by your own bias or interests
- Ensure opportunities aren’t overlooked
- Be able to share with other people (product stakeholders) how you reached your conclusions
- Know what you don’t know

### Thematic Analysis

Thematic analysis is a systematic method of breaking down and organizing rich data from qualitative research by tagging individual observations and quotations with appropriate codes to facilitate the discovery of significant themes. For in-depth guidance on conducting thematic analysis and related workshop activities, consider referring to the following resources:

- **[How to Analyze Qualitative Data from UX Research - Thematic Analysis:](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/thematic-analysis/)** Thematic Analysis: This resource offers insights into the process of conducting thematic analysis in UX research.

- **[Workshop Activities:](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/workshop-activities/)** Explore this article for workshop activities related to thematic analysis, providing practical exercises for honing your analytical skills.

### Thematic analysis method

**STEP 1:** Familiarize yourself with your data.<br>
**STEP 2:** Search for patterns across all the interviews<br>
**STEP 3:** Identify preliminary themes<br>
**STEP 4:** Review themes<br>
**STEP 5:** Name and define themes<br>

### Additional Tips for Thematic Analysis

- **Watch your bias!** Be aware of your own biases and how they might influence your analysis.
- **Interpret the data as honestly as you can.** Avoid interpreting the data in a way that aligns with your preconceived notions.
- **Stay focused on analyzing data that is relevant to the goals of your project.** Filter out noise and focus on insights that directly contribute to your project's objectives.

## Design Sprint

A design sprint is a structured and time-bound process used by teams to quickly conceptualize, prototype, and test new ideas or solutions. It's typically done in a span of about one to five days and aims to address challenges and develop innovative solutions through a collaborative and iterative approach. For additional resources and detailed methodologies related to design sprints, you can explore:

- **[Sprint](http://www.gv.com/sprint/)** This link provides more information about the design sprint methodology.

- **[Phase 2 Design](https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/phase2-define)** Explore this resource for insights into the second phase of the design sprint process, focusing on defining and refining your ideas.

1. **Understand:** Identify the problem.
2. **Diverge:** Generate a bunch of ideas.
3. **Converge:** Pick the best idea.
4. **Prototype:** Make a simple model of your idea.
5. **Test:** Get feedback from real users.
6. **Iterate:** Improve your idea based on feedback.
7. **Decide:** Choose whether to pursue the idea further.

The process is quick, collaborative, and helps teams avoid wasting time on ideas that might not work. Here is a quick video to help you dive deeper into the practical aspects of implementing a design sprint:
