## Persona Creation

### What they are and what they are not

**Personas are**

- Real needs based on user behaviours, expectations and context of use
- What it takes to accomplish goals
- Unarticulated information that you can observe during interviews and observation sessions
- Foundation for user-centered product design

**Personas are not**

- What the organization thinks users should have in the product
- What early adopters want: early adopters represent a niche group of users who you may identify from research. You may even want to have a supplement persona to represent them and keep them in mind, but you donâ€™t design for them
- What programmers want
- What customers ask for (remember this is product marketing research and not use research)
- Socially accepted preferences and attitudes

### Analyze the Data

1. Look at a **range of variables** across a **range of participants**, and find the **patterns that are meaningful** to your project.

- Identify the variables or attributes by reviewing the data from your interviews
- Rank each participant against each attribute
- Look for common traits among participants who share similar attributes
- Each group of similar participants with similar attributes and common traits can be formed into a persona

2. Identify which **attributes are not shared**, so you can account for those in your design.

Example: Participant A may seek both regular ongoing support, as well as ad-hoc support, but it may not translate into a separate persona.

3. Determine which groups (personas) you will design for:

- Multiple personas > which personas are in scope and which are not
- Still multiple personas > identify which are primary, and which are secondary

### Synthesize a model of users

When you have your groups of users identified, think of how to best describe them.

Once you have your groups of users identifies, decide how to describe them. What is the narrative, the bio that describes their commonalities.

- The common attributes that you identify from research helped you group your users in a few personas. However, the traits that you capture in the persona document may be different.
- Decide what you want to include in the persona document.

Example: Bio for a high school student persona interested in learning about cyber security

### The anatomy of a persona document

Remember that a persona is a tool for the entire product team to use. Make it relevant!

### Socialize your personas

After your persona document is created, it is very important to socialize them. Personas represent a tool that only brings value if it is used.

You do this in different ways:

- Organize a persona presentation and invite all the stakeholders who need to know about them and use them
- Print the persona document as a poster and display it on walls in common areas where people group (kitchen, hallways, etc) or if you work remotely, have a product page where you provide regular updates that people look for
- Use the personas when you write user stories or when you have planning meetings
- Find creative ways to socialize them and get people to buy into them and use them because they see their value
