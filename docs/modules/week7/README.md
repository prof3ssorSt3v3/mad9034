# Week 7: User scenarios and information architecture

::: warning Required Preparation

Please ensure that you prepare for each week's lessons by thoroughly reviewing the weeks module prior to the start of class. This preparation is essential to ensure you are fully informed and ready to actively engage in the upcoming topics and discussions. Your active participation and success in the course depend on meeting this requirement diligently.

:::

## Learning Objectives

- Have a solid understanding of the why, when, what, and how to create scenarios
- Translate user research data to create a usage scenario
- Harness your knowledge of information architecture (IA) to create high-level navigation for your product
- Learn other IA technique for user flow mapping

## Scenarios

### Definition and Goals

Scenarios are short stories that provide context behind why a specific user group represented by a persona use your product and how this persona is planning to carry on a key task.

**Summary**

- Scenarios can be developed once you have your personas.
- They are a form of storytelling meant to bring life to an abstract use case scenario.
- They describe how a group of users represented by a persona, intend to carry on a key task in your product.
- A scenario provides context for the usage of the product without going into a great level of detail.

**Goals**

- Document the goals and questions to be achieved by users (persona)
- Define the different ways taks can be accomplished with the product
- Give life to an abstract use case scenario

### Personas and Usage Scenarios

[Scenario Mapping: Design Ideation Using Personas](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/scenario-mapping-personas/)

**A usage scenario describes:**

the persona’s current situation
a hypothetical, improved one that the persona will have with the new product
