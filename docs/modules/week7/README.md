## Scenarios

### Definition and Goals

Scenarios are short stories that provide context behind why a specific user group represented by a persona use your product and how this persona is planning to carry on a key task.

**Summary**

- Scenarios can be developed once you have your personas.
- They are a form of storytelling meant to bring life to an abstract use case scenario.
- They describe how a group of users represented by a persona, intend to carry on a key task in your product.
- A scenario provides context for the usage of the product without going into a great level of detail.

**Goals**

- Document the goals and questions to be achieved by users (persona)
- Define the different ways taks can be accomplished with the product
- Give life to an abstract use case scenario

### Personas and Usage Scenarios

[Scenario Mapping: Design Ideation Using Personas](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/scenario-mapping-personas/)

**A usage scenario describes:**

the persona’s current situation
a hypothetical, improved one that the persona will have with the new product

| **Example:** Cynthia wants to create a shopping list from her family’s wish list.                                                                                                                                          | **Example:** Cynthia navigates to the wish lists > selects the items she wants to buy and > adds them to the shopping list.                                                                                                                            | **Example:** As Cynthia, the grandparent, I want to have a straightforward way to add the items from the wish list to the shopping list, so that I can purchase the gifts for my family.         |

### Why might we use scenarios?

To answer these questions:

1. **Who** is the user?
2. **Why** does this user use my product?
3. **What** does this user want from my product?
4. **How** can this user achieve their goals?
5. **Why** does this persona want to use my **product and not a different one?**

### Types of Scenarios

1. **Goal-Based/Task-Based**
   Focus only on what the user wants to do defining information architecture and content usability testing scenarios

   ![Scenario type 1](./scenario-type-1.png)

2. **Elaborated**
   Better understand the persona to design for better understand how the persona characteristics may affect the interaction with the product/service helps craft the right content and functionality for a specific user type

   ![Scenario type 2](./scenario-type-2.png)

3. **Full Scale Task**
   Includes the steps required to complete a task from a user’s perspective how the product would support the task-oriented or elaborated scenario that you started with

Cynthia is traveling to see her family for Christmas and she wants to get her shopping done early.

- Opens the wish list app
- Sends a request to her family for wish lists
- Receives notifications when a family member added items to the wish list
- Adds items from the wish list to the shopping list
- Purchases the items online
- Checks the wish list which has all the purchased items checked off

### Best Practices

**Source:** User research<br>
**Format:** Narrative<br>
**Actor:** Persona<br>
**Goal:** The goal/task that the persona wants to accomplish<br>
**Summary:** Summarize the scenario, motivations, persona goals, etc. Steps Each step required to complete goal<br>
**Context of Use:** The actual conditions the app is used (in a normal day-to-day working situation, at home, etc)<br>

### Usage

1. **Design Ideation:**

- Focus on your user’s tasks
- Eliminate bias
- Organize the content and entry points into the key tasks in a manner that makes sense to your users

2. **Usability testing:**

- Orient user research around your users’ tasks > evaluate how effectively your product supports these tasks.
- Identify the key steps required to complete the task > observe the path followed by users > evaluate the effectiveness of your product’s architecture and navigation.

### Dos and Don’ts

**DON’T** Marty clicks on the username input field then types his name. He then clicks on the password input field and enters his password. Marty clicks on the login button.

**DO** Marty signs into the product.
