## Usability Testing

### Understanding the Basics

Usability testing, also known as user testing, involves evaluating a prototype, product, or service by testing it with real users. The primary goals are to:

- Identify design problems.
- Discover opportunities for improvement.
- Gain insights into user behavior.

### Why Usability Testing?

![Context of use: Usability Testing](./usabilityTesting.png)

Usability testing provides valuable information about:

- A user's ability to complete tasks.
- The time it takes to complete tasks.
- User satisfaction.
- Opportunities for improvement.
- Overall performance.

**Prototyping and Usability** Testing give product teams the confidence to try new ideas, because they will be validated before too much time or money is invested.

### Key Elements

When conducting usability testing, pay attention to these key elements:

- **What to Test:** Define the specific tasks and flow that you want to evaluate. It sets the stage for a focused assessment.
  (Learn more: [Usability Testing 101](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-testing-101/))

- **Prototype Fidelity:** Decide the level of detail your prototype should have. This impacts how realistically users can interact with it.

- **Participants:** Select participants who truly represent your target audience. Their feedback will be the most valuable.

- **Facilitator and Note Taker:** Appoint roles for guiding the usability test and capturing valuable observations.

By addressing these elements, you'll ensure a comprehensive usability testing process that yields actionable insights.

## The Usability Testing Process

### Execution

- **Participant:** They interact with the prototype one task at a time while vocalizing their thoughts.
- **Facilitator:** Observes without interference and may ask clarifying questions.
- **Note Taker:** Records both quantitative and qualitative data.

### Measuring and Analyzing Data

**Quantitative Data** includes metrics like success rate, error rate, task completion time, and user satisfaction.

**Qualitative Data** covers the participant's navigation path, encountered problems, comments, recommendations, and answers to open-ended questions.

## Reporting Findings

In usability testing, reporting is crucial. Share both positive and negative findings, and include:

- Direct user quotes when possible (create personas).
- Quantitative data, such as task completion rates and satisfaction levels.
- Problem severity levels (critical, serious, minor).
- Recommendations for addressing issues.
- Next steps in the UX process.
