# Week 3: Ideation and Prototyping

::: warning Required Preparation

Please ensure that you prepare for each week's lessons by thoroughly reviewing the weeks module prior to the start of class. This preparation is essential to ensure you are fully informed and ready to actively engage in the upcoming topics and discussions. Your active participation and success in the course depend on meeting this requirement diligently.

:::

## Learning Objectives

- Have a deeper understanding of the role of design and prototyping in the UXD process
- Have learned and practiced some design and prototyping skills, using appropriate tools
- Be introduced to key design software available to be used throughout the term

## Ideation

### Definition and Goals

Ideation is a creative process intended to generate many ideas.

**Goals**

- Ask questions, innovate, think outside the box, explore ideas “blue sky” without any restrictions (time, resources, technical limitation, budget, etc).
- Bring together perspectives of multiple stakeholders
- Uncover unexpected areas of innovation
- Generate a large volume of ideas to build on

**Principles of Ideation**

- Open mind
- Volume
- Divergent thinking
- No wrong ideas

| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Brainstorming           | - Generating ideas in a group <br> - Leveraging the group’s diversity <br> - Building on one another’s ideas                                                                              |
| Braindumping            | - Similar to brainstorming, but done individually <br> - Simply write down your own ideas <br> - Combine ideas and build on them                                                          |
| Storyboarding           | - Develop a story related to the problem you’re solving <br> - Bring the situation to life <br> - Explore different scenarios to see where the story goes                                 |
| Challenging Assumptions | - Step back and consider the assumptions you have about the product <br> - Try to get ‘unstuck’ of current thinking <br> - Are constraints truly constraints, or just what we’re used to? |
| Worst Possible Idea     | - Flip brainstorming on its head <br> - Bad, silly ideas to train the mind to think differently <br> - Easier to critique - low personal commitment                                       |
| SCAMPER                 | - Substitute <br> - Combine <br> - Adapt <br> - Modify <br> - Put to another use <br> - Eliminate <br> - Reverse                                                                          |
| Role Playing            | - Changes how participants think about something <br> - Develops new thoughts and ideas <br> - Can be uncomfortable for some <br> - The role of the system or another person              |
| Co-Design / Co-Creation | - Collages <br> - Cognitive and context mapping <br> - Storyboards <br> - Inspiration cards <br> - Modeling <br> - Paper prototyping <br> - Games                                         |

## Brainstorming

Brainstorming is one of the most common methods of ideation that all of you will likely be involved in, either a facilitator or a contributor.
For a brainstorming session to be successful, there are some guidelines to follow:

1. Set a time limit
2. Start with a problem statement
3. Defer judgment - no wrong ideas
4. Encourage open, “blue sky” ideas
5. Quantity over quality
6. Build on each other’s ideas
7. Be visual
8. One conversation at a time

**Physical space**

1. Safe, casual and fun environment
2. Comfortable, casual seating
3. Atmosphere conducive to creativity
4. Treats

**Online**

1. Consider an ice breaker
2. FigJam or Miro-like software
3. Provide high-level structure along with problem statement

## Prototyping

### Definition and Goals

A prototype is an early model or sample which is built for the purpose of testing and learning.

**Goals**

- Test a design hypothesis
- Learn, improve and gain confidence in a product or idea before investing time and money in the implementation

### What might you test with a prototype?

**Usability**

- Layout
- Affordance or feedback
- Terminology

**Navigation:** Ensure users have all the navigation they need to accomplish the task at hand

**Functionality:** Ensure users have all the interactive elements they need to perform the task at hand

**Alternate designs:** If there are multiple options for users to accomplish the task at hand, determine which one is most frequently chosen by users

### Elements of a prototype

**What you want to test:** determines what goes into a prototype.

**Scope:** Enough screens for participants to imagine completing the task that you want to test.

**Fidelity:** Choose a prototyping method that provides just enough fidelity to answer the key questions you have.

**Content:** Include enough real or realistic content for participants to respond to it accordingly, and provide useful feedback.

**Interactivity:** Include interactivity -- at any level of fidelity -- to test how a user would navigate through content, screens, and apps themselves.

### Determining what to test

The first step is to decide what you want to test, which determines what goes in your prototype.

**Step 1:** Define the scope of your prototype. Choose a task or a path that you want to test with your participants.

- List the screens and steps that you need to include in the prototype to ensure the right amount of detail.
- Too many screens can result in a waste of time and loss of interest
- Not enough screens can make it difficult to the participant to understand the task/path

**Step 2:** List the content that needs to be included on each screen

- Can you use placeholder text, or do you need meaningful text to help the participants understand the task better
- Do you need to show a list of filters, etc

**Step 3:** Decide on the level of fidelity required. This depends on what it is that you are testing. I.e.:

- Location of a control on the screen, structure, content layout: low-fidelity
- Tasks flows and navigation: mid-fidelity
- Micronterations, behaviours, transitions, task completion: high-fidelity

**Step 4:** Decide if your prototype needs to be interactive. You may decide to only make one path interactive.

- If you want to test a task completion, or where the user will go when a button is selected, you may not need interactivity. It may be enough for the participant to indicate what button they would interact with.
- If you want to test an animation, a transition, a more complex behaviour, interactivity is important

### Prototyping Methods

**Paper Prototype (Early design stage)**
Use a paper prototype in early stages of the design to get a reaction to the clarity of the user interface and the general flow before you commit to a specific design path.

**Advantages**

- Inexpensive
- Quick
- Possible in the early stages of design and development
- Easy to create and modify
- Collaborative
- Avoids distraction with superficial detail (no bells and whistles) If a prototype or a mockup are too high-fidelity, often stakeholders who are not designers get hung up on colours, shape, irrelevant details instead of focusing on flow.

**Digital Prototype (Any design stage)**
A digital, interactive prototype can be created at any stage of the design process. You may choose to test one path, an entire workflow, or a micro interaction.

**Dev Prototype (Test complex designs before final implementation)**

- Engage a developer to create a dev prototype when you have more complex functionality that you may have incomplete requirements for, or that is key to the general workflow of the product that you are working on.
- Chose a dev prototype over a Figma prototype when the functionality requires database calls, or other complexity that is not possible to reproduce in an interactive design prototype.
