## Ideation

### Definition and Goals

Ideation is a creative process intended to generate many ideas.

**Goals**

- Ask questions, innovate, think outside the box, explore ideas “blue sky” without any restrictions (time, resources, technical limitation, budget, etc).
- Bring together perspectives of multiple stakeholders
- Uncover unexpected areas of innovation
- Generate a large volume of ideas to build on

> Ideation is NOT design-by-committee.

**Principles of Ideation**

- Open mind
- Volume
- Divergent thinking
- No wrong ideas

|                         |                                                                                                                                                                                           |     |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| Brainstorming           | - Generating ideas in a group <br> - Leveraging the group’s diversity <br> - Building on one another’s ideas                                                                              |     |
| Braindumping            | - Similar to brainstorming, but done individually <br> - Simply write down your own ideas <br> - Combine ideas and build on them                                                          |     |
| Storyboarding           | - Develop a story related to the problem you’re solving <br> - Bring the situation to life <br> - Explore different scenarios to see where the story goes                                 |     |
| Challenging Assumptions | - Step back and consider the assumptions you have about the product <br> - Try to get ‘unstuck’ of current thinking <br> - Are constraints truly constraints, or just what we’re used to? |     |
| Worst Possible Idea     | - Flip brainstorming on its head <br> - Bad, silly ideas to train the mind to think differently <br> - Easier to critique - low personal commitment                                       |     |
| SCAMPER                 | - Substitute <br> - Combine <br> - Adapt <br> - Modify <br> - Put to another use <br> - Eliminate <br> - Reverse                                                                          |     |
| Role Playing            | - Changes how participants think about something <br> - Develops new thoughts and ideas <br> - Can be uncomfortable for some <br> - The role of the system or another person              |     |
| Co-Design / Co-Creation | - Collages <br> - Cognitive and context mapping <br> - Storyboards <br> - Inspiration cards <br> - Modeling <br> - Paper prototyping <br> - Games                                         |     |

## Brainstorming

Brainstorming is one of the most common methods of ideation that all of you will likely be involved in, either a facilitator or a contributor.
For a brainstorming session to be successful, there are some guidelines to follow:

6. Build on each other’s ideas
7. Be visual
8. One conversation at a time

**Physical space**

1. Safe, casual and fun environment
2. Comfortable, casual seating
3. Atmosphere conducive to creativity
4. Treats

**Online**
