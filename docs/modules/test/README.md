### 1. Network for Children with Disabilities

Families with **children with disabilities** often struggle to **find extra-curricular activities** that are appropriate for their child's special needs. Programs are few and far between, poorly advertised and therefore difficult to find, and often end up getting cancelled due to inadequate registration.

**You will work on designing an app where these activities can be posted and searched.**

There will be three main parts to the app:

- An interface for posting activities, adding necessary details for families to browse and understand them (ex. time, location, age range, abilities supported)
- An interface for browsing, searching, viewing and comparing activities
- An interface for creating a profile with a family's specific needs and requirements (ex. location, age range, interests, special needs, etc.)

**You will focus on the browsing/searching interface AND the profile-creating interface. You will simply account for the posting interface in your overall framework and architecture**
