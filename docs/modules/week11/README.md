## Detailed Design

**Summary**: Detailed design is the process of refining and specifying all the elements of a product's interface. It involves finalizing the layout, controls, icons, typography, and visual design to ensure a cohesive and functional user experience.

## Risks and Unknowns

### All Stages of the Process

Even with ample time and resources, unknowns or changes are inevitable from the research completion to the product release. Adaptability and agility are crucial, accepting that some aspects will only be validated once the product is in users' hands.

- Unknowns exist at all levels of the process.
- Initial research often uncovers more questions.
- Operate with assumptions and hypotheses, validating them through analysis and user feedback.
- Design phase uncertainties persist even after prototyping and user testing.
- Prototyping typically covers only parts of the application, leaving some areas untested.
- Each testing cycle clarifies some questions but may also introduce new ones.

**Key Areas:**

- **Research**: Gaps in understanding, risks in user needs.
- **Analysis**: Hypotheses are uncertain and need validation.
- **Design**: Unknowns about product implementation and user interaction.
- **Prototype**: Inability to test everything.
- **Testing**: Clarification and emergence of new unknowns.

### Working with Uncertainty

Uncertainty in UX design can stem from unclear requirements, time constraints, resource limitations, or changes in market, technology, user needs, and business priorities.

"Uncertainty is the state of not knowing or being able to predict the outcome or consequences of an action or decision."

**Tips on Embracing Uncertainty:**

- Embrace ambiguity as an opportunity for innovation and exploration.
- Manage uncertainty as a source of learning and improvement.
- Foster collaboration to define common goals and embrace uncertainty together.
- Develop resilience by viewing potential failures as learning opportunities.

  - [How can you evaluate UX design when faced with uncertainty and ambiguity?](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/how-can-you-evaluate-ux-design-when-faced)

### How to Identify Risks

- **Market Risks**: Evaluate market needs and competitive landscape. Consider new product initiatives and their market viability.
- **Product Risks**: Assess if the product delivers customer value, its MVP status, and competitive advantage.
- **Risks in Use**: Document potential user errors and their consequences, like security issues or data loss.

Mitigation involves thorough market research, user research, ideation, prototyping, and testing. Be ready to pivot and adapt to changes in technology and market.

### Working with Risks

#### Market Risks

<DetailsCard imageSrc=/f2023/moduleImages/week11/valueProposition.png>

- Use tools like the [Value Proposition Canvas](https://www.strategyzer.com/library/the-value-proposition-canvas) for market need evaluation and competitive analysis.
- Collaborate with Product Marketing for insights into market risks.
- Organize focus groups, build prototypes, and conduct usability testing.

</DetailsCard>

#### Product Risks

<DetailsCard imageSrc=/f2023/moduleImages/week11/productRisks.png>

- Assess design, value, usability, feasibility, and viability risks.
- Conduct customer interviews, market analysis, and review mining.
- Engage in QA processes, test with real data, and consider accessibility.
- Discuss technical aspects with the team, considering quality attributes and system integration.

**Definition and Benefits:**

> “Lean UX is a collaborative, cross-functional design approach that establishes the true nature of a product in a fast, user-centered way.”

**Goals and Benefits:**

- Maximize value and minimize waste in software design.
- Based on the principle: think > make > check.

**Reducing Risks with Lean UX:**

<DetailsCard imageSrc=/f2023/moduleImages/week11/reducingRisks2.png>

- Emphasize rapid customer testing to reduce product risk.
- Engage customers/users at all stages of product design and delivery.
- Validate design concepts early and continuously.

| Small, incremental testing to assess the assumptions around a design hypothesis | Comprehensive research, analysis, ideation, prototyping and testing to ensure the product meets the users’ needs very well |
|              It requires extensive cross-functional collaboration               |
