## Product Research

### Definition and Goals

[Product research - Meaning, Importance, Stages, Example.](https://www.mbaskool.com/business-concepts/marketing-and-strategy-terms/8598-product-research.html#3)

Product research involves systematically gathering and analyzing information to understand a specific product, its market, and potential customers.

#### Goals:

- Understand the market segment.
- Analyze the competitive landscape.
- Identify strengths and weaknesses of competing products.
- Define your product's competitive advantage.
- Explore how your product can gain market share.

### Product Research vs User Research

Product Research focuses on the market and existing products, while User Research delves into user needs and behavior.

|     Product Research Studies      |      User Research Studies      |
| :-------------------------------: | :-----------------------------: |
|            The market             |            The user             |
| Products that exist in the market |           Unmet needs           |
|           Product risks           |         Product demands         |
|           Market risks            |        Product features         |
|     What people say they want     |        What people need         |
|       What people will buy        | How people will use the product |

#### Benefits

- **Informed Decision-Making:** Data-driven insights minimize risks and increase the likelihood of product success.
  A well researched product will meet the requirements of the customer in a much better way. Understanding the competition can really help make a product which solves known product issues in that market.
- **Customer-Centric Approach:** Tailoring products to customer needs enhances satisfaction and builds brand loyalty.
  It helps companies to understand what the customers really want, and what is likely to succeed in the market using available technology.
- **Competitive Edge:** Thorough research identifies gaps in the market, leading to innovative and unique solutions.
  It can help to refine new product ideas.

#### Components

- Business research
- Market research
- Competitive analysis
- Brand research

In a nutshell, market research is valuable because it shows us broad information; user research is valuable because it gives us deep insights.

- **Product research** >> **what people want**
- **User research** >> **what people need**
  - Evaluates users’ ability to complete tasks, and their satisfaction with the product

#### Example: The Power of Product and User Research

**Product Research:** In a product research study, it was discovered that travelers expressed a desire for lighter luggage. This finding seemed to suggest that reducing the weight of luggage would address their concerns.

**User Research:** However, a deeper understanding emerged through user research. Observing travelers at the airport revealed that the real issue was not just the weight of the luggage but the challenge of carrying it from point A to point B. It became evident that what people needed was luggage with wheels to ease the burden of transportation.

**Conclusion:** This example underscores the significance of both types of research in positioning a product effectively in the market and determining the core needs it should address.

Market research provides valuable broad insights, while user research delves deeper, uncovering the root issues users face. Depending on the business context, one or the other may take precedence – market research is essential for shaping business models, while user research guides feature prioritization and design decisions.

In essence, this case highlights that a balanced approach, leveraging both market and user research, is crucial for steering product development in the right direction.

## User Research

The user persona offers a deeper level of detail, focusing on a subset of individuals within the target market who have shared objectives and requirements. Through a user persona, intricate aspects come to life, enabling all stakeholders of the product to connect with this individual on an instinctual level. These personas encompass the human elements of names, occupations, distinct traits, abilities, aspirations, and challenges. Constructing a user persona fosters empathy for this individual, a crucial factor in shaping product choices.

> "Personas help everyone from programmers to executives understand users in a way no other tool can: at a gut level. Personas help guide design decisions, end those lengthy arguments about what users need, and get everyone to agree on what product you're building."​<br>(Alan Cooper, American software designer and programmer, coined the term “persona” for the first time)

### Why we need them

![Why we need personas](./whyPersona.png)

Thousands of people located in multiple geographical locations, with various cultural expectations and product demands, with different roles and responsibilities, time investment and levels of expertise and sophistication distilled down to a few user personas.

### A Product Team Tool

1. **Condense Diverse User Profiles**: In any given target market, you'll encounter a diverse range of individuals with varying needs, preferences, and behaviors. User personas help condense this diversity into a few representative profiles, making it easier to design for your entire audience.

2. **Remove Biases**: Designing for your "average" user can introduce biases and overlook the needs of specific user segments. User personas help in eliminating these biases by considering the unique characteristics of different users.

3. **Maintain Focus**: With well-defined user personas, your team can maintain a clear focus on who the product is intended for. This prevents feature creep and ensures that product decisions align with the needs of your primary users.

### Primary and Secondary Personas

- **Primary Persona**: The primary persona represents the core users of your product. These are the individuals who will benefit the most from your solution.

- **Secondary Persona**: Secondary personas represent users whose needs must be accommodated without compromising the primary user's experience. These users may have different requirements, but their interaction with the product should not detract from the primary persona's satisfaction.

### Steps to Create User Personas:

1. **Identify Your Users**: Begin by identifying the individuals who make up your target audience. This includes gathering demographic, geographic, psychological, and behavioral data. You can source this information from various channels.

2. **What and How to Ask**: Conduct interviews, focus groups, and surveys to collect insights from potential users. Ensure that your questions are open-ended to encourage participants to share their thoughts and experiences freely. [Sample interview Script](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/a-closer-look-at-personas-part-2/#1-identify-your-users)

3. **Get Access to Users**: Establish contact with potential users. If you have an existing user base, leverage it to gather data. If you're a new company or launching a new product, consider researching competitors' users to gain valuable insights.

4. **Gain an Understanding of the Users**: Dive deep into the experiences of your potential users. Understand their pain points, motivations, goals, and challenges related to the problem your product aims to solve.

5. **Analyze the Data**: Examine the data collected from interviews, focus groups, and surveys. Identify patterns, commonalities, and significant differences among users.

6. **Synthesize a Model of Users**: Create user personas by aggregating the information into detailed profiles. Each persona should include demographic information, goals, frustrations, behaviors, and any other relevant details.

7. **Produce a Persona Document**: Document the key details of each persona in a structured document. Include their name, age, job title, goals, pain points, and a brief narrative that humanizes the persona.

8. **Socialize the Personas**: Share the personas with your project team and stakeholders. Ensure that everyone involved in the product development process understands and empathizes with the personas. Personas should become a reference point for decision-making throughout the project.

User personas are powerful tools that keep the user at the center of the design process. By following these steps, you can create personas that inform and guide your product's development, ensuring that it meets the diverse needs of your target audience.
