## Product Research

### Definition and Goals

[Product research - Meaning, Importance, Stages, Example.](https://www.mbaskool.com/business-concepts/marketing-and-strategy-terms/8598-product-research.html#3)

Product Research refers to the systematic process of gathering and analyzing information to better understand a specific product, its market, and its potential customers.

**Goals**
Learn about:

- Market segment
- Competitive landscape
- Strengths and weaknesses of competitive products
- Competitive advantage of your product
- How your product can gain market share

### Product Research vs User Research

|     Product Research Studies      |      User Research Studies      |
| :-------------------------------: | :-----------------------------: |
|            The market             |            The user             |
| Products that exist in the market |           Unmet needs           |
|           Product risks           |         Product demands         |
|           Market risks            |        Product features         |
|     What people say they want     |        What people need         |
|       What people will buy        | How people will use the product |

**Benefits**

- **Informed Decision-Making:** Data-driven insights minimize risks and increase the likelihood of product success.
  A well researched product will meet the requirements of the customer in a much better way. Understanding the competition can really help make a product which solves known product issues in that market.
- **Customer-Centric Approach:** Tailoring products to customer needs enhances satisfaction and builds brand loyalty.
  It helps companies to understand what the customers really want, and what is likely to succeed in the market using available technology.
- **Competitive Edge:** Thorough research identifies gaps in the market, leading to innovative and unique solutions.
  It can help to refine new product ideas.

**Components**

- Business research
- Market research
- Competitive analysis
- Brand research

In a nutshell, market research is valuable because it shows us broad information; user research is valuable because it gives us deep insights.

- **Product research** >> **what people want**
- **User research** >> **what people need**
  - Evaluates users’ ability to complete tasks, and their satisfaction with the product

### Example

**Product research:** showed that travellers wanted a lighter luggage, yet literally lighter in weight luggage did not end the complaints.

**User research:** Observing people use the luggage at the airport revealed the actual problem which was carrying the luggage from point A to point B. A wheeled luggage was the actual solution to the problem, not a lighter in weight luggage.

**Conclusion:** Both types of research are very important to position a product in the market and to decide what needs the product should meet.

Market research is valuable because it shows us broad information; user research is valuable because it gives us deep insights. Sometimes a business needs one (to draw up a business model); sometimes it might need the other (when deciding which features are prioritised).
What is clear, though, is that both kinds of research are important. Without the directions that they give, a product will be steered blindly.

### Business Research

Business research is an essential component of product research and development. It involves gathering, analyzing, and interpreting data to make informed decisions about various aspects of a product's development, launch, and ongoing success in the market.

**Components**

- Economic conditions and other factors at play

**How to do it**

### Market Research

**Components**

- Market size and characteristics
- Market expectations
- Demands and opportunities
- Risk mitigation

**How to do it**

- Surveys or interviews
- Focus groups
- Secondary research (company records, research studies, books)

### Competitive Analysis

## User Research

The user persona offers a deeper level of detail, focusing on a subset of individuals within the target market who have shared objectives and requirements. Through a user persona, intricate aspects come to life, enabling all stakeholders of the product to connect with this individual on an instinctual level. These personas encompass the human elements of names, occupations, distinct traits, abilities, aspirations, and challenges. Constructing a user persona fosters empathy for this individual, a crucial factor in shaping product choices.

> "Personas help everyone from programmers to executives understand users in a way no other tool can: at a gut level. Personas help guide design decisions, end those lengthy arguments about what users need, and get everyone to agree on what product you're building."​<br>(Alan Cooper, American software designer and programmer, coined the term “persona” for the first time)

### Why we need them

Thousands of people located in multiple geographical locations, with various cultural expectations and product demands, with different roles and responsibilities, time investment and levels of expertise and sophistication distilled down to a few user personas.

### A Product Team Tool

- Provide focus for product stakeholders
- Refer to the “users” by persona name
- Remove biases
- Keep the number low
- Represent diversity

### Primary and Secondary Personas

|                           |                                                                                                                                     |
| :-----------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|    **Primary persona**    |                                                        **Secondary persona**                                                        |
| primary user of a product | is another user of the product for whom we will make accommodations as long as the primary persona’s experience is not compromised. |
|     Service Consumer      |                                                          Service Provider                                                           |

### Steps to create them

1. **Identify your users**

   - Existing user base
     - Get existing demographics data
     - If no existing demographics data, survey current users
   - No user base (new company/product)
     - Research users of your competitors or similar companies, products or services
   - Whether you conduct the research yourself, or hire a third party research company to do it, the first step if to establish a selection criteria for the participants.
   - Your criteria for the screener may include demographic, geographical, psychological and behavioural information depending on the project that you are working on.

2. **What and how to ask (interviews, focus groups, surveys)**
   Start by asking permission to record the interview so you can go back and listen to it again in case you missed something.
   Ask open ended questions as much as possible

   - Don’t ask leading questions.
     - Example: Let’s pretend that you work on an app that provides extra-curricular activities for children with disabilities. If you ask a person: Would you like to be able to print the list of activities? chances are they will say yes. If you probe, often they don’t know why, but when you ask them if they want something they will usually say yes. Instead, you can ask: How will you use the list of activities provided by the application? And see if they tell you that printing is an important use case.
   - Ask about their present and past experiences
   - Depending on the project you work on, sometimes you may want to ask them to imagine an ideal product. However, not everyone can do that. Know that many people adapt to how a product works and cannot articulate what they want to see different. This is why it is better to ask them about their experience and you will determine what works, what doesn’t and whether things can be presented to the user in a different way
   - Ask for stories and details that you cannot observe yourself

3. **Get access to users**
4. **Gain an understanding of the users**
5. **Analyze the data**
6. **Synthesize a model of users**
7. **Produce a persona document**
8. **Socialize the personas with other stakeholders**
