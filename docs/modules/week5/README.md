## User Research

The user persona offers a deeper level of detail, focusing on a subset of individuals within the target market who have shared objectives and requirements. Through a user persona, intricate aspects come to life, enabling all stakeholders of the product to connect with this individual on an instinctual level. These personas encompass the human elements of names, occupations, distinct traits, abilities, aspirations, and challenges. Constructing a user persona fosters empathy for this individual, a crucial factor in shaping product choices.

> "Personas help everyone from programmers to executives understand users in a way no other tool can: at a gut level. Personas help guide design decisions, end those lengthy arguments about what users need, and get everyone to agree on what product you're building."​<br>(Alan Cooper, American software designer and programmer, coined the term “persona” for the first time)

### Why we need them

Thousands of people located in multiple geographical locations, with various cultural expectations and product demands, with different roles and responsibilities, time investment and levels of expertise and sophistication distilled down to a few user personas.

### A Product Team Tool

- Provide focus for product stakeholders
- Refer to the “users” by persona name
- Remove biases
- Keep the number low
- Represent diversity

### Primary and Secondary Personas

### Steps to create them

1. **Identify your users**

   - Existing user base
     - Get existing demographics data
     - If no existing demographics data, survey current users
   - No user base (new company/product)
     - Research users of your competitors or similar companies, products or services
   - Whether you conduct the research yourself, or hire a third party research company to do it, the first step if to establish a selection criteria for the participants.
   - Your criteria for the screener may include demographic, geographical, psychological and behavioural information depending on the project that you are working on.

2. **What and how to ask (interviews, focus groups, surveys)**
   Start by asking permission to record the interview so you can go back and listen to it again in case you missed something.
   Ask open ended questions as much as possible

   - Don’t ask leading questions.
     - Example: Let’s pretend that you work on an app that provides extra-curricular activities for children with disabilities. If you ask a person: Would you like to be able to print the list of activities? chances are they will say yes. If you probe, often they don’t know why, but when you ask them if they want something they will usually say yes. Instead, you can ask: How will you use the list of activities provided by the application? And see if they tell you that printing is an important use case.
   - Ask about their present and past experiences
   - Depending on the project you work on, sometimes you may want to ask them to imagine an ideal product. However, not everyone can do that. Know that many people adapt to how a product works and cannot articulate what they want to see different. This is why it is better to ask them about their experience and you will determine what works, what doesn’t and whether things can be presented to the user in a different way
   - Ask for stories and details that you cannot observe yourself

3. Get access to users
4. Gain an understanding of the users
5. Analyze the data
6. Synthesize a model of users
7. Produce a persona document
8. Socialize the personas with other stakeholders
